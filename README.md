# Seasonal-Weather-Conditions-and-Crop-Suggestions-for-Farmers-Using-Big-Data-Technologies
The project is a static serverless web application hosted on AWS S3 that provides farmers with valuable information of expected seasonal weather conditions at specific locations such as average temperature, average seasonal rainfall and average humidity that is expected to be prevalent for the particular season in that location. Furthermore, using these weather variables, crops are suggested to farmers that can be propagated in the given season. Historical weather data that was recorded hourly for 20 years was used to conduct mathematical calculations to provide concise analysis on it to find expected average temperature, seasonal rainfall and humidity values at season - location level for the oncoming year to help farmers plan their cultivations efficiently. While the farmers can use their domain knowledge and information from the application to plan their type of harvest, the application also provides suggestions on crops based on the expected weather variables. To provide reliable crop suggestions, insights were carried out on a crop dataset with weather variables that aligned with the chosen expected weather variables provided in the application. The project also explores the final resultant dataset to gain meaningful insights from it using Visualization.
